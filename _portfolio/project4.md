This scrolltrap was made to demostrate how social media platforms manipulate users into spending time on their platform and incorporate them into their money making trategy. Users of the website are exposed to the techniques or 'dark patterns' used by social media companies to manipulate their user base. Either trying to get users to stay on the platform for as long as possible or to make money from them. Along with these dark invision of a social media platorm, an alternative example is also shown to the user to give an example of a harmless version of the social media platforms we know today. The main goal of this project was to raise awareness of these dark patterns and the maliscious intents of most social media platforms. To test the effect of the website on how people view social media a usertest was conducted.
