This scrolltrap was made to demostrate how social media platforms manipulate users into spending time on their platform and incorporate them into their money making strategy. Users of the website are exposed to the techniques or 'dark patterns' used by social media companies to manipulate their user base. Either trying to get users to stay on the platform for as long as possible or to make money from them. Along with these dark invision of a social media platorm, an alternative example is also shown to the user to give an example of a harmless version of the social media platforms we know today. The main goal of this project was to raise awareness of these dark patterns and the maliscious intents of most social media platforms. To test the effect of the website on how people view social media a usertest was conducted.

During this project I wanted to take on a more leading role within the team. Facilitating the teams needs to better teamwork and trying to introduce tructure into the project. I feel like I have gained some skills in leading a project, namely leading standups, retrospectives, facilitating workflows and making sure team members are up to date on each other. Some more concrete skills I have picked up during my time working on this project are working with websites which I hadn't done before. Getting familiar with React.js and creating a web page. Transitioning from C# to JavaScript was a challenge because of my limited experience, but ultimately I am proud of the final product we developed and the personal development journey that came with it. to read more about my personal development journey during the Dark tech semester, my persoanl development plan is listed below.
