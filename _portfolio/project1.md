This project was about making a functioning Beat 'em up game within the span of a semester. Hellbound express is a 2.5D beat 'em up game where the player assumes the role of a condemned train robber fighting their way out of hell. The purpose of this assignment was to practice creating enticing gameplay, something that would capture the target audience by putting gameplay mechanics first. 

The most important things I learned during this time was on how I build a level and create a layout with user experience in mind. I learned how to incorperate UX into my design. During this time i also followed a git course to gain a better grasp on how to use git. My role within the team during this project was more of a designer although we were not very strictly role-bound as team members. I designed levels and programmed them into existence, I designed two enemy types and developed them into existence aswell and I tried getting a better grasp on process management by learning a bit about how git works. In the end I can day that I am proud of the work that I put into this project and what I achieved during this time.
