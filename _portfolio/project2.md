The assignment was to create a final boss battle of any sort. Our team opted for a 'souls like' boss battle with a twist. The only movement available to the player was via a grappling hook by which the player has to swing around the map while avoiding attacks from the horrible Ant Queen. Once every couple of attacking rounds the queen would summon her minions of which I worked on the AI for. 

During this project I first came into contact with AI or creating a form of AI to controll the ant minions. The role I took on during this project was one of the lead developers. Since I wasn't always the best at coding I wanted to prove myself by trying something new by working on some type of AI which was a challenge for me. I wanted to challenge myself and prove my worth as a developer and a student. Besides this a big part of that project for me was learning about UserTesting and more precisely how to do it. I did research on how to set up, perform and plan out a playtest adn documented both the research and how I implemented the gained knowledge on the documentation page listed below.
